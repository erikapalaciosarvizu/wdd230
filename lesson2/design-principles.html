            <p class="paragraph">Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. It is a system to prioritize elements so that they are easily understood. The design elements that make up the principle of visual hierarchy include:
                Color: Bright colors attract more attention than muted colors.
                Composition: Place the most critical elements at the top and subsequent information in the order of importance.
                Contrast: Contrasting elements, such as contrasting colors or typefaces, have an inherent dramatic effect and draw attention.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the target's size, the longer it takes.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The rule of thirds is a principle used in design, photography, and art to create visually appealing compositions. It involves dividing an image into nine equal parts by creating two equally spaced horizontal and vertical lines. The resulting grid contains four intersections or sweet spots in the center, which are the natural focus of the human eye when looking at an image.</p>
